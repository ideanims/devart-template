I first noticed the announcement a couple of weeks ago, while sitting at the quad surrounded by technology, art, design and education. 

Since then, I had been thinking about my first DevArt project and explored several ideas. The APIs, the tools, the technologies and all the content out there flowing through the Net like the Ganges and the Niagara Falls. 

I looked at my strong areas and my recent interests. Over 10 years of application development experience, web and database expertise, years of hobby electronics, decent exposure to iPhone apps, and recent exposure to arduinos. 
And my deep interest in stunning visual designs. 

And Alice was born. 

My proposal borrows from the rich imagery of the Lewis Carrol classic and creates a modern version of the journey that takes Alice through all the wonderlands. 

Never ending tweets provide the core energy flow through the model and a mobile app and an arduino create the interactive environment that controls the energy and allows the user to dwell on moments worth cherishing. 

Proof of concept tests are in progress, and the final proposal may not be what we read here. My hope is, evolution on these pages will be as educational and entertaining as the end product. 

More soon, this intro should be enough reason for a repeat visit. 

Here is my initial sketch.
