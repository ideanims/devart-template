##Streaming Into OpenGL 

Reached a major milestone in the display of Twitter message shells on the main canvas using OpenGL. 
Worked on spacing and animation parts and looked into refining the interaction piece. 

It became more clear that an iPhone/iPad app could play a very useful role in enhancing the user experience. 
Worked on the functionality that would be provided by the mobile app. 

I also looked closer into the layout of the space around the exhibit items.  

##OpenGL Tweets

Here is a sample image of the OpenGL rendering of the tweets:

![Tweet Shells](../project_images/TweetShells.jpg?raw=true "Tweet Shells")

The final one will have a lot more density and the colors are markers and placeholders. 

##Hardware 

The Arduino work is on hold just for a day, since there was not much coding involved.
