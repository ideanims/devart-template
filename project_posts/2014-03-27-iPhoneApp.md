##Managing and Interacting with the Display

Developed and tested the iPhone app that will start the OpenGL animation and allow the audience to interact with the display
The app has two screens, the first one to start and stop the animation and the second one to tweet that Alice has been spotted in a city from a short list (for the prototype). 
  

##Mobile App

Here are screenshots of the iPhone app:

This one launches the OpenGL animation:

![Animation Launcher](../project_images/AliceMobi1.jpg?raw=true "Launch Animation")


This one is used by the audience to tweet the location of Alice, which will be responded to by the animation. 

![Alice Locator](../project_images/AliceMobi2.jpg?raw=true "Tweet Location")

I am wrapping up the main OpenGL app, also done in an Xcode environment. 
Everything should be up on the site soon, with less than a day left!
