##Final Update

My project will not be ready in time for submission.
The key component of this project is OpenGL-based. 
This is the first time I am coding in it and I found there were so many variations in environments and capabilities. 

I did learn a lot but I would be doing injustice to my artwork if I didn't implement everything I wanted to see in it. 
And we have run out of time for this competition. 

I will continue to work on this and share updates maybe in a different setup. 

Meanwhile, I wish everyone who participated in this, good luck, and I have been inspired by what you have accomplished here. 

I will be following the process and I am excited the competition is now moving to an interesting stage!
