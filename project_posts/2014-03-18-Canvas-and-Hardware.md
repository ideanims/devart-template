Canvas Elements: 

After so much of rough sketching, reviews, revisions etc., it was time to put the design elements on paper. 
So the canvas version one is here. 

I am also updating the project main page with a detailed description. For this post anyway, briefly, the bulk of the project 'output' will be on the canvas, created using the display attached to the Mac. 

The canvas shows a cross section of the underground referred in the story, where Alice falls through a rabbit hole. 
On the canvas, we have rows and rows of inverted "Y" images representing the path downwards. 

Each of these images will be tied to some content on the Internet almost in realtime. 

A rough sketch is included below. 

I was able to create some of it using OpenGL in a Mac OSX/XCode project. More work needs to be done.

On the Hardware Side:

I also started looking into communication needs between the Mac and the Arduino piece. Bluetooth may be sufficient, since there will be limited amount of data flowing from the Arduino piece to the Mac, and practically nothing in the opposite direction. Wi-Fi would really be an overkill. iPhone app's role is not yet clear. But if used, Wi-Fi might work out better for that segment. There will be no communication between the Arduino piece and the iPhone app. 


It is exciting to see small pieces of the puzzle falling into place. The big ones are still moving around.
