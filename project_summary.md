## Description

Alice uses the familiar computer display as a digital canvas to capture the energy within tweets and to drive an interactive decision graph that will randomly supplement the visual imagery with content from other sources using multiple tools and APIs.   

Lewis Carrol's classic about Alice in Wonderland provides a thematic backdrop and also enhances an awareness of the time shift in this digital art experiment. 

The project uses OpenGL, XCode, C++, Objective-C, Twitter API etc. and involves rendering a dynamic image interrupted by Alice spotting. 

Project not ready for submission. Work continued separately.
